      "name":"Baingan Bharta",
      "category": "Vegetarian",
      "instruction": "Rinse the baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Apply some oil all over and\r\nkeep it for roasting on an open flame. You can also grill the baingan or roast in the oven. But then you won't get\r\nthe smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly\r\ncooked. You could also embed some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it.\r\n2. Roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid\r\neasily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools\r\ndown.\r\n3. You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is an optional step.\r\nUse natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red.\r\n4. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted\r\naubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.\r\n5. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the\r\ncharcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta will\r\nbecome. I just keep for a minute. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is\r\ncooked, just like the way we do for Dal Tadka.\r\n6. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant.\r\n7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it.\r\n8. In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.\r\n9. Saute the onions till translucent. Don't brown them.\r\n10. Add chopped green chilies and saute for a minute.\r\n11. Add the chopped tomatoes and mix it well.\r\n12. Bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts separating from the mixture.\r\n13. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix well.\r\n14. Add the chopped cooked baingan.\r\n15. Stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the onion\\u00adtomato masala mixture.\r\n16. Season with salt. Stir and saute for some more 4 to 5 minutes more.\r\n17. Finally stir in the coriander leaves with the baingan bharta or garnish it with them. Serve Baingan Bharta with\r\nphulkas, rotis or chapatis. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.",

      "instruction":"Take a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil in it. Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown. Then take them out on a plate and set aside.\r\nTo the same pot, add the chopped garlic and saut\\u00e9 for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes and cook until tomatoes turn soft. This would take about 5 minutes.\r\nThen return the fried onion to the pot and stir. Add ginger paste and saut\\u00e9 well.\r\nNow add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies. Give them a quick stir.\r\nNext goes in the spices \\u2013 turmeric powder and red chilli powder. Saut\\u00e9 the spices well for couple of minutes.\r\nAdd the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through. This would take about 15 minutes. Slowly saut\\u00e9ing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat.\r\nWhen the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesn\\u2019t split. Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried fenugreek leaves. Mix well.\r\nFinally add the cream and give a final mix to combine everything well.\r\nSprinkle the remaining kasuri methi and garam masala and serve the chicken handi hot with naan or rotis.

      "instruction":"Grind the cashew, poppy seeds and cumin seeds into a smooth paste, using as little water as possible. Set aside. \r\n\r\nDeep fry the sliced onions when it is hot. Don\\u2019t overcrowd the oil. When the onions turn light brown, remove from oil and drain on paper towel. The fried onion will crisp up as it drains. Also fry the cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside.\r\n\r\nWash the rice and soak in water for twenty minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, take a big wide pan, add oil in medium heat, add the sliced onions, add the blended paste, to it add the green chillies, ginger garlic paste and garlic and fry for a minute.\r\nThen add the tomatoes and saut\\u00e9 them well till they are cooked and not mushy.\r\n\r\nThen to it add the red chilli powder, biryani powder, mint, coriander leaves and saut\\u00e9 them well.\r\nAdd the yogurt and mix well. I always move the skillet away from the heat when adding yogurt which prevents it from curdling.\r\n\r\nNow after returning the skillet back to the stove, add the washed lamb and salt and \\u00bd cup water and mix well. Cook for 1 hour and cook it covered in medium low heat or put it in a pressure cooker for 6 whistles. If the water is not drained totally, heat it by keeping it open.\r\n\r\nTake another big pan, add thrice the cup of rice you use, and boil it. When it is boiling high, add the rice, salt and jeera and mix well. After 7 minutes exact or when the rice is 80% done. Switch off and drain the rice.\r\n\r\nNow, the layering starts. To the lamb, pat and level it. Add the drained hot rice on the top of it. Garnish with fried onions, ghee, mint, coriander leaves and saffron dissolved in milk.\r\n\r\nCover the dish and bake in a 350f oven for 15 minutes or till the cooked but not mushy. Or cook in the stove medium heat for 12 minutes and lowest heat for 5 minutes. And switch off. Mix and serve hot!\r\nNotes\r\n1. If you are cooking in oven, do make sure to cook in a big oven safe pan and cover it tight and then keep in oven for the final step.\r\n2. You can skip biryani masala if you don\\u2019t have and add just garam masala (1 tsp and red chilli powder \\u2013 3 tsp instead of 1 tsp)\r\n3. If it is spicy in the end, squeeze some lemon, it will reduce the heat and enhance the flavors also.",
